prototyping and avoiding naming conventions and instead using # combinations and the refactor to name using find/replace feature.
  *this has proven successful but found I needed to keep a legend.  i.e.  # = controller ## = model...
    NN to streamline legend build for direct dump into find.

collect the bricks/assets prior to build.  i.e. grab seed data, image sources, etc.  idea is to have the build material at the ready so you don't have to break from the build to find the "bricks", adding to the time bank available to research build issues.
  not sure if this worked.  It was convenient though.
